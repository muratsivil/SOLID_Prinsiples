In this work, I did a study on how to use SOLID principles.

	1. Single Responsibility Principle
	2. Open & Close Principle
	3. Liskov Subtitution Principle
	4. Interface Segregation Principle
	5. Dependency Inversion Principle

SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY PRINSIBLE : 
	According to this principle, a class can only have one task. A function loaded in a method must not be more than one.

OPEN & CLOSE PRINCIBLES : 
	Each time we want to create a new class of a new type, we want to create these classes in a comfortable way. Already oop supports extensibility. It is necessary to install the architect so that only the recently added class will be checked, and existing changes will not need modification of existing classes.

LISKOV SUBTITUTION PRINCIPLE : 
	Subclasses must also be replaced by objects that are formed, and superclasses must also be replaced by objects that are formed.

INTERFACE SEGREGATION PRINCIPLE : 
	Classes must be implemented from interfaces that contain features and behaviors that they do not need.

DEPENDENCY INVERSION PRINCIPLE : 
	The dependence of a class, method, or property on other classes that use it should be minimized. Changes made to a subclass should not affect the superclasses.
